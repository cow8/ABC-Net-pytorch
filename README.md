# [*UNDER CONSTRUCTION*] ABC-Net-Pytorch

## TO-DO

## Problems
- the way to solve alpha. In the paper(ABC-Net), the method is not specified. In this implementation, the lstsq(scipy.linalg.lstsq) method is adopted.

## Notes
I find some preoblem of this paper reported in the [notes](https://github.com/cow8/ABC-Net-pytorch/raw/master/notes.pdf)
